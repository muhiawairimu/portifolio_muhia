Adding Social Media Links
To add your social media links:

Replace the href attribute of the <a> tags in the social media section with your actual social media profile URLs.
Example for WhatsApp:

Copy code
<a href="https://wa.me/1234567890" target="_blank">
  <i class="fab fa-whatsapp fa-2x"></i>
</a>
Customizing the Carousel
Add images to the carousel-item elements in the HTML file. Each carousel-item can have an image source, caption, and description.

Example:

html
Copy code
<div class="carousel-item">
  <img src="path/to/yourimage.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="Slide 2">
  <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
    <h1>Custom Slide Title</h1>
    <p>Slide description here.</p>
  </div>
</div>
Modifying Header and Navigation
To customize the header or navigation links, update the content within the <header> section of the HTML file. CSS for the header can be edited in the custom CSS section or the main CSS file.
